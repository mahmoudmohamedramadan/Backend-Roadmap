# Back-end Roadmap

[![TALL-Stack](https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/Backend-Roadmap/blob/main/assets/tallstack-logo.png)](https://tallstack.dev/#components)

## üßê Introduction

Before embarking on studying any track you must be familiar with a **Science** such as (Data Structure, Algorithms, and Problem-Solving) because they will help you more in your technical life and there is no interview free from questions about them. In addition, you have to have a good knowledge of ([Security](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path), and [Networking](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-network-http)). It is known also that the `Back-end` is considered a second phase after `Fron-end` ([HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)) which is considered the first phase, so it will be fine if you were familiar with `Front-end`. FINALLY, you must be good at [`Design Patterns`](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) because you'll meet them more when you study `Back-end`, and when you reach the Laravel framework you'll find out that the most advanced topics in Laravel are based on common design patterns such as `Facade` design pattern.

## üì¢ Prerequisites

- [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) || [Laragon](https://laragon.org/)
- [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) || [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

> `Xampp` and `Laragon` are local development tools and you can choose BETWEEN them to use according to your comfort, but personally, I prefer to use `Xampp`, also you can choose BETWEEN `PhpStorm` and `VS Code` according to your comfort, but personally, I prefer to use `VS Code` for simplicity and speed, and in case you choose to use `VS Code` I recommend using these helpful [Extensions](#vs-code), also I recommend using these useful [Chrome Extensions](#chrome). `Composer` is a dependency manager for PHP, you'll need it to install, update, and remove the packages in your PHP or Laravel projects. It's fine to explore Laravel with [`Laravel Sail`](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail) and [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/) because it allows you to work easily on any Laravel version without being obsessed with compatibility problems.

## üï∏ Awesome Extensions

### VS Code

- PHP Debug
- PHP Inteliphense
- Laravel Extension Pack
- Auto Rename Tag
- Error Lens
- PHP Class Generator
- PHP Snippets
- vscode-icons
- MySQL
- GitHub Copilot
- M.R Darkest Theme
  
### Chrome

- [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
- [Fake Filler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-filler/bnjjngeaknajbdcgpfkgnonkmififhfo)
- [Blackbox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blackbox-select-copy-past/mcgbeeipkmelnpldkobichboakdfaeon)

> `GitHub Copilot` is a very awesome tool, but please use it in production applications only, not while learning, but it's become paid now, so I recommend using [Blackbox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Blackboxapp.blackbox), but if we will compare BETWEEN them, `GitHub Copilot` will win.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üêò Beginner Level

[Laravel 7 Basics tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe30vg_FG4OSCTUv3XIkwH--cK2D7rfJJ)

> You may ask why should I learn more than one version of Laravel, what if I learn the latest version ONLY? My answer is that learning more than one version gives you more experience. In addition, every version contains its new features ONLY, and this makes you ignore the old version's features.

#### Livewire: Sarthak Shrivastava

Here you'll learn `Livewire` framework, that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel ü§Ø

> This step is optional, but I recommend learning `Livewire` as it'll relieve you from AJAX problems, also you may like to use [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) because it's a very lightweight Javascript framework. If you'd like to learn `Vue.js` you can watch [Vue.js Tutorials & Examples](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzDuaT7kEURZQbw9dQHepK9).

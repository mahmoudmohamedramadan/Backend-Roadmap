# Backend Roadmap

[![TALL-Stack](https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/Backend-Roadmap/blob/main/assets/tallstack-logo.png)](https://tallstack.dev/#components)

## 🧐 Introduction

Before diving into any track, it's essential to first familiarize yourself with foundational **sciences** such as **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and **Problem-Solving**, as these will significantly benefit your technical career. No technical interview is complete without questions related to these topics. Additionally, having a solid understanding of [**Security**](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path) and [**Networking**](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-network-http) is crucial.

It’s also important to know that **Back-end Development** is often considered a second phase after mastering **Front-end Development**. The first phase includes understanding the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), so it’s perfectly fine if you're familiar with these before moving on to back-end technologies.

Finally, it's essential to get comfortable with **[Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)**. These patterns will become increasingly relevant as you study **Back-end Development**. When you reach advanced frameworks like **Laravel**, you'll find that many of its most advanced features are built on well-known design patterns, such as the **Facade** pattern.

## 🧰 Tools

- [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) || [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) || [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) || [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

> `Xampp` and `Laragon` are local development tools and you can choose BETWEEN them to use according to your comfort, but I prefer to use `Xampp`, you can select BETWEEN `PhpStorm` and `VS Code` according to your comfort, but I prefer to use `VS Code` for simplicity and speed, and in case you choose to use `VS Code` I recommend using these helpful [Extensions](#vs-code), also I recommend using these useful [Chrome Extensions](#chrome). `Composer` is a dependency manager for PHP, you'll need it to install, update, and remove the packages in your PHP or Laravel projects. It's fine to explore Laravel with [`Laravel Sail`](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail) and [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/) because it allows you to work easily on any Laravel version without being obsessed with compatibility problems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🐘 Beginner Level

#### Basics: Elzero

At first, we will use PHP programming language in our `Back-end` journey as a powerful language 🎯

#### OOP: Elzero

Second, to be a master at PHP, you'll need to be a hero in OOP 🐱‍🏍

> You can watch [Object Oriented PHP Tutorial](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0eyrZgxdwhypQiZnYXM7z7-OTkcMgGPh) as a optional choice for Elzero course.

#### Types Of Filters: Elzero

Third, you must know security topics in PHP such as `Sanitization` and [`XSS`](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) 🐱‍💻

[Validate vs Sanitize](https://youtu.be/uXpQSrx8aqw)

#### Database: Elzero

After you become a master in PHP, you'll need to know more about databases 🗂

[MySQL 5 Essential Training](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAz6DT8SzQ1CODJTH-NIA7R9)

#### Payment Gateway: Traversy Media

Sometimes you need to provide payment gateways to your site such as ([Hyper Pay](https://www.hyperpay.com/), [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), ...etc), so you can watch the next tutorial 💳

[PHP, MySQL & Stripe API Payment App](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-Rfqbb8OFHzQhkEElaReewJlwca)

> You can see how I implement the `Hyper Pay` payment gateway, as explained in [Delivery Management](https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/Delivery-Management).

#### API: Traversy Media

Finally, after you’ve finished `PHP` & `MySQL`, you'll need to know how to create APIs to be usable via `Android TEAM` 🐙

[PHP REST API From Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbZ3_Xr8do7Q2R752xYrDRAo)

> After finishing PHP tutorials, you can look over its [Awesome Packages](https://github.com/odan/learn-php), and say hello to my recap that you'll find in [Awesome PHP](https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/Awesome-PHP).

#### GitHub: Elzero

### 🚦 Intermediate Level

#### Laravel 5.x: Coder’s Tape

Here you'll learn many things about Laravel, but in an old version 5️⃣

[Laravel 5.8 - From The Ground Up](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpzy7FIRqpGD0kxI48v8QEVVZd744Phi4)

#### Laravel 7.x: Sarthak Shrivastava

Here you'll learn more and more about Laravel, [`Livewire`](https://laravel-livewire.com/), and [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/) 7️⃣

[Laravel 7 Basics tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe30vg_FG4OSCTUv3XIkwH--cK2D7rfJJ)

> You might be wondering, *"Why should I learn more than one version of Laravel? What if I focus only on the latest version?"* The answer is that learning multiple versions broadens your experience. While each new version of Laravel introduces exciting features, it can also cause you to overlook valuable functionality or concepts from older versions. By exploring different versions, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the framework's evolution, making you a more adaptable and well-rounded developer.

#### Livewire: Sarthak Shrivastava

Here you'll learn the `Livewire` framework, that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel 🤯

[Laravel Livewire Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe30vg_FG4OQ8b813BDykoYz95Zc3xUWK)

> This step is optional, but I recommend learning `Livewire`, **which helps you avoid** AJAX-related issues. **You might also want to consider** using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), as it's a very lightweight JavaScript framework. If you're interested in learning `Vue.js`, you can check out [Vue.js Tutorials & Examples](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzDuaT7kEURZQbw9dQHepK9).

### 🐲 Advanced Level

#### Packages: Andre Madarang || Sarthak Shrivastava

- [Andre Madarang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEhEHUEU3x5pcQJHE8WBLqlHt2o3q5O-f)
- [Sarthak Shrivastava](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe30vg_FG4ORrveWqHjn-9C5sn5mUP815)

> When working on a project for a client, you likely won't want to send them the raw project files directly, and you may not have a private domain or host set up yet. In such cases, I highly recommend using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download). This fantastic tool lets you quickly publish your project with a secure, temporary URL, giving you virtual hosting for sharing and testing purposes.
